Compact lensless brain-implantable CMOS image sensor (CIS) developed in NAIST by the Photonic Device Science Laboratory

Description:
Welcome to the repository for the lensless brain-implantable CMOS image sensor developed by the Photonic Device Science Lab, led by Prof. Jun Ohta. This innovative device represents a significant advancement in neuronal imaging technology, offering a compact and efficient solution for studying neural activity in vivo.

The focus of this repository is on the needle-type device, which enables minimally invasive implantation and high-resolution imaging of neuronal activity. The repository contains design files and documentation related to the development and fabrication process of the CMOS image sensor.

Key Components:

1. PCB Design: The repository includes the blueprint of the PCB designed specifically for this project. The board, named "3T_AMS_TSKY-Needle40×120_ver.3," was meticulously designed to accommodate the CMOS image sensor and other necessary components for seamless integration into experimental setups.

2. CMOS Chip Design: The heart of the lensless brain-implantable CMOS image sensor is the custom-designed CMOS chip. Using electronic design automation (EDA) tools from Cadence Design Systems, Inc., our team meticulously crafted the specifications for the image sensor. The designed data was then transferred to Austria Micro System (AMS), a renowned foundry company specializing in semiconductor fabrication. The chip was fabricated using AMS standard 0.35 µm CMOS technology as part of a multi-chip project.

Collaboration and Contributions:
We invite researchers, engineers, and enthusiasts in the field of neuroscience and biomedical engineering to explore this repository and contribute to the ongoing development of lensless brain-implantable CMOS imaging technology. By collaborating and sharing insights, we can further advance our understanding of neural circuits and ultimately contribute to advancements in neurology and neurotechnology.

Thank you for your interest in our project. We look forward to your contributions and feedback.
